Maturity Model (DSMM) helps organizations protect their sensitive information by developing a data-centric approach to security. Overall, the DSMM shares a similar structure with some of the most well-known security frameworks in the industry, most notably the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This will hopefully allow organizations to integrate it more easily into their existing security and privacy efforts and augment their investment in other frameworks.</p><h2 id="why-use-dsmm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-use-dsmm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why use DSMM</h2><p>Many security models cover key aspects of data security and privacy, but the DSMM brings a uniquely &quot;data-centric&quot; approach not found in other models. While traditional data protection strategies have typically focused on narrowly defined use cases or specific threats, the DSMM aims to help organizations take a broad, more consistent approach to protect any or all of their data. Such an approach is a growing priority for security leaders as enterprise data has become incredibly dynamic both in terms of how it is used and where it resides. No longer sequestered in databases, today&#39;s data is constantly being used, modified, and shared by users over dozens of applications. Data likewise can exist virtually anywhere, including in end-user devices, traditional and SaaS applications, and a variety of other cloud services.</p><p>A data-centric approach to security ensures that risk context and policy enforcement can be applied to any data and can follow the data itself wherever it moves or however it is modified. Instead of relying on network-based boundaries, a data-centric approach is able to &quot;follow the bouncing ball&quot; of data, so to speak, without losing visibility and control. This type of approach is essential for organizations to fully leverage the power of their data while also keeping it safe from external threats, insider threats, or simple mistakes that can put the availability, confidentiality, or integrity of data at risk.</p><p>Organizations also have access to new types of data security and privacy tools that can make such a data-centric approach far more practical and reliable than ever before. In the past, the limitations of traditional tools often made data security efforts highly laborious and limited to very narrow use cases. A recent wave of innovation is now enabling organizations to extend data security principles to virtually any type of data, anywhere in the enterprise. The DSMM is designed to provide a blueprint to help organizations align available tools and practices to the unique needs and risks of their environment.</p><h2 id="how-to-navigate-the-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-navigate-the-model" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How to Navigate the Model</h2><p>The DSMM is organized into five key Functions of a data security program. These Functions are:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#did-identify-and-classify">Identify and Classify</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#dpr-protect">Protect</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="dde-detect">Detect</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#drs-respond">Respond</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#drc-recover-and-improve">Recover and Improve</a></strong></li></ul><p><img src="/images/dsmm-legend.svg" alt="DSMM Legend"></p><p>Each <strong>Function</strong> covers multiple underlying <strong>Objectives</strong>. Objectives focus on a particular aspect of security that supports the higher level <strong>Function</strong>. For example, <em>Data Discovery</em> is an <strong>Objective</strong> within the <strong>Identify</strong> and <strong>Classify</strong> <strong>Functions</strong>. Each <strong>Objective</strong> is addressed at up to three <strong>Levels</strong> of maturity. Each level includes practices/activities that are needed in order to meet the given level of maturity and include example methods and tools that can be used to implement and fulfill those practices. These example methods and tools are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to provide some basic references and guidance for users of the model. Organizations are encouraged to investigate and identify the methods, tools, and processes that make the most sense for their unique needs.</p><p>Most <strong>Objectives</strong> contain three Levels of maturity. Each ascending Level introduces an improvement in the degree to which the Objective is met and/or an increase in the scope of the Objective. For example, Level 1 Discovery may cover manual identification and tagging of data in select locations or databases, while Level 3 would cover the automated discovery of all sensitive information in all locations. Level 3 Objectives have the broadest scope and level of completeness/sophistication. The use of the word &quot;all&quot; in these levels should not imply that an organization has to be perfect in order to achieve the Level of maturity. Naturally, perfection is rarely possible in real-world security practice. Instead, we use the word &quot;all&quot; to denote that the scope of the Objective is not specifically constrained, such as limiting policy to a certain type of data or a certain location.</p><p>Organizations are unique, and likewise their appropriate level of maturity will vary based on their unique needs and risks. Readers can refer to the <a href="#example-scenarios">Example Scenarios</a> section in the Appendix for additional guidance on how to pick the appropriate levels of maturity for their organization.</p><p>Additionally, Objectives and Practices are quite often interrelated and, therefore, feed into one another. For example, <strong>Identifying</strong> sensitive data will play a key role in <strong>Protecting</strong> data. Likewise, better <strong>Detect</strong> capabilities will often support enhanced <strong>Respond</strong> efforts. The model also supports feedback from later Objectives and Practices to earlier ones. For example, lessons learned from an incident review or detection should likely be incorporated into the policies that are implemented in the <strong>Protect</strong> phase.</p><p>As data security is in a phase of rapid evolution, we also encourage active collaboration on the DSMM. Suggestions for updates to the model or inclusion of specific controls or methods can be shared at: <a href="mailto:suggestions@datasecurity.org">suggestions@datasecurity.org</a>.</p><h2 id="key-terms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-terms" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Key Terms</h2><p>The nomenclature for the DSMM is similar to that found in other, mainstream security frameworks and standards, especially the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2).</p><h3 id="functions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#functions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Functions</h3><p>provide a high-level, lifecycle-oriented view of an organization&#39;s management of cybersecurity – in this case, focusing specifically on data security and privacy.</p><h3 id="objectives" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#objectives" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Objectives</h3><p>(alternately referred to as capabilities) are cybersecurity outcomes that are closely tied to programmatic needs. They are mid-level achievements that are accomplished by implementing the Practices that comprise them.</p><h3 id="practices" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practices" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Practices</h3><p>Are the most fundamental component of the DSMM. Each Practice is a brief statement describing a data security/privacy activity to be performed by an organization. The purpose of these activities is to achieve and sustain an appropriate level of security/privacy, commensurate with an organization&#39;s tolerance for risk and its overarching business objectives. Within each Objective, Practices are organized to progress along a maturity scale.</p><h2 id="referencing-dsmm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#referencing-dsmm" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Referencing DSMM</h2><p>DSMM can be seamlessly integrated with external tools and reporting systems using a standardized referencing system. Each objective within the model possesses a unique identifier to facilitate this integration process. The identifiers adhere to a specific format, and maturity levels can be represented through a simple dot notation.</p><p>The standard format for identifiers is as follows:</p><p><code>D&lt;Function Ref&gt;&lt;Objective Number&gt;.&lt;Maturity Level&gt;</code></p><p>The table below provides examples to illustrate the application of these identifiers:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Identifier</th><th>Function</th><th>Objective</th><th>Maturity Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DID002.L3</td><td>Identify and Classify</td><td>Data Flows and Context</td><td>Level 3</td></tr><tr><td>DDE002.L2</td><td>Detect</td><td>Analysis Methods</td><td>Level 2</td></tr><tr><td>DRC002.L1</td><td>Recover and Improve</td><td>Incident Review / Lessons Learned</td><td>Level 1</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="defining-data-security-program-goals" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#defining-data-security-program-goals" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Defining Data Security Program Goals</h2><p>The first step in any data security program is to specify the business strategy and goals for the organization.</p><ul><li>Identify the business priorities, and the way in which data security and privacy advance the business outcomes.</li><li>Define the scope of data to be secured: this may be a manual process to determine what data is important to the business.

More specifically, risks include:</p><ul><li><strong>Data availability</strong> : information being lost or not available</li><li><strong>Data integrity</strong> : Malicious and intended or accidental altering of data</li><li><strong>Data confidentiality</strong> : Data being exposed to unauthorized entities</li></ul><p>The likelihood of a risk materializing, and its associated business impact, depend on the type of data, its location, and whether the security team knows about it.</p><p>This <strong>Function</strong> can involve a variety of technical tools as well as more staff-driven processes such as meeting with internal employees and leaders to identify important data for each business unit.</p><p>Higher levels of maturity will force organizations to expand their Identify and Classify efforts beyond narrowly defined projects or regulatory requirements. This often requires leadership to take a more open-ended approach to how they assess data security and consider additional types of data or use cases that should be included in the data security program. However, the open-ended approach provides meaningful security and business outcomes by getting to and addressing the root causes of an organization&#39;s risk. In many cases, this leads to a reduction in security events and less work for security teams, who can then shift from reactive efforts to a more proactive approach.</p><p>The following set of questions can help leaders take a more comprehensive approach to their data security and uncover areas of risk that might not be initially obvious.</p><ul><li><p>What data contains the organization&#39;s intellectual property or trade secrets? This may include direct forms of IP such as source code or design files, as well as more indirect sources such as emails, documents, and presentations for product plans, etc.</p></li><li><p>What data would cause damage to the organization (financial, competitive, reputational, etc.) if it were lost or exposed to the public?</p></li><li><p>What data would be more valuable to an attacker than to the organization?</p></li><li><p>How does the organization quantify the damage caused by a breach or data security event?</p></li><li><p>How does the organization track the spread of data after it has been accessed? How are derivatives or copies of data identified?</p></li><li><p>Is there a consistent approach for discovering/tracking sensitive data across data stores, user devices, applications, and cloud? Can the organization confirm if sensitive data was deleted on a user&#39;s device or is sitting in the recycle bin?</p></li><li><p>How does the organization identify data owners? Once identified, do data owners understand their reposibilities for classification, business impact analysis, and risk management?</p></li><li><p>How will the organization automatically classify sensitive data that may not conform to rules and signatures (e.g., non-patterned, non-textual, or other complex types of data)?</p></li><li><p>To what extent should ongoing classification efforts be manual or automated? Will staff or end-users be required to perform classification functions?</p></li></ul><h3 id="did001-data-discovery" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#did001-data-discovery" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DID001: Data Discovery</h3><p>The goal for this <strong>Objective</strong> is to find all data covered by the data security program. Achieving higher levels of maturity requires progressively expanding the scope of coverage, moving from narrowly focused or project-based data security efforts to a more holistic approach that can identify additional types of data critical to the organization. Other objectives in this function will focus on data flows and classification while <strong>Data Discovery</strong> measures a company&#39;s ability to find data in both structured and unstructured formats.</p><p>Level 1 will aim to identify data that already exists most of the time, while Level 3 will focus on ensuring data is properly identified and tagged at creation, using automation. For example, a retail organization may include well-known sources of sensitive data such as regulated customer PII as a standard element of Level 1. Higher levels of maturity could expand the scope of the data program to include data at rest discovery across all internal assets such as user laptops and additional data types such as M&amp;A plans, which may not be initially covered, but could have a massive business impact if compromised. The associated methods/tools also progress from ad-hoc and mostly manual to continuous and increasingly automated.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Levels</th><th>Practices</th><th>Methods/Tools</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>L1</td><td>Implement focused discovery: often project-based,this process identifies known, well-defined, high-risk data sets (e.g., database with PII).</td><td>Selective, reactive process - can include manual processes or automated tools such as tagging or other DDR tools capable of automatically tracing data based on provenance.</td></tr><tr><td>L2</td><td>Employ expanded discovery based on goals at a business/organizational level.

While Identify and Classify is designed to help map out an organization&#39;s data risk, Protect focuses on mitigating that risk. Most organizations will have multiple types of sensitive data, and the appropriate level of protection can naturally vary based on the type of data or business use case, as guided by the Data Risk Assessment Objective. In fact, a single piece of content may contain multiple types or classifications of sensitive data (e.g. PII and PHI), and the organization may need to consider which protection rules should take precedence when protecting data.

Studies have proven that one of the most effective ways to change unwanted user behavior is via just-in-time, contextual training, which alerts users in real time when they are engaging in potentially risky behavior. This &quot;adaptive response&quot; allows users to interact, give feedback and learn about the proper data handling requirements.

aria-hidden="true">#</a> Getting Started with DSMM</h3><p>The Data Security Maturity Model helps organizations protect their data and critical assets by developing a data-centric approach to security, ensuring that risk context and policy enforcement follow the data no matter how it moves or is modified. This ability to protect any type of data across devices, applications, and cloud assets is essential if organizations are to take advantage of the power of modern collaboration and digital transformations without exposing their data to external threats, insider threats, or simple mistakes.</p><p>The DSMM is organized into five key Functions – <strong>Identify and Classify</strong> , <strong>Protect</strong> , <strong>Detect</strong> , <strong>Respond</strong> , and <strong>Recover and Improve</strong>. Each Function covers multiple underlying Objectives, which focus on a particular aspect of security that supports the higher level Function.</p><p>While the DSMM provides the details of each Function, this Appendix provides a guide to the overall process so that organizations can get started easily and improve their data security posture quickly.</p><h3 id="assess-organizational-data-needs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#assess-organizational-data-needs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Assess Organizational Data Needs</h3><p>Every organization is unique both in terms of data real estate and tolerance for risk. The Data Security Maturity Model is designed to adapt to the needs of each organization. The appropriate maturity level for each objective will vary based on each organization&#39;s unique risk profile.</p><p>However, many data security programs have long been constrained by the limitations of old-school security tools – often limiting data security to narrowly defined DLP and regulatory use cases. Recent innovations in data security technologies enable organizations to apply data security controls far more universally than ever before, including the ability to protect any data, in any location, and at any time. As such, it is important - from both a security and a business point of view - to take a fresh look at the organization through the lens of its data. This means evaluating all the organization&#39;s data assets in terms of the impact of that data being lost, exposed, or otherwise misused or rendered unavailable. As a result, organizations may want to take the following steps:</p><ul><li>Collaborate with all business units to identify the data critical to each group or operational function.</li><li>Identify all intellectual property and trade secrets regardless of data or file type.</li><li>For each type of data, assess the competitive, financial, and reputational impact if the data were exposed or unavailable.</li></ul><h3 id="identify-target-data-security-levels-and-identify-gaps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#identify-target-data-security-levels-and-identify-gaps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Identify Target Data Security Levels and Identify Gaps</h3><p>The assessment done in Step 1 is the foundation for using the model, since it answers the question of precisely what data is in scope for the model. Based on this assessment, organizations will next address each of the key Functions of the maturity model. For each Function, several Objectives are presented, containing (generally) three Levels of maturity. Each ascending Level introduces an improvement in the accuracy and reliability of meeting the Objective and/or an increase in the scope of the Objective. For example, Level 1 Discovery covers manual identification and tagging of data in select locations or databases, while Level 3 calls for the automated discovery of all sensitive information in all locations.</p><p>It is important to note that organizations will likely have different target levels of maturity for various types of data and use cases. For example, source code or product designs may warrant Level 3 for the &quot;Preventing Misuse&quot; objective, while internal HR data may only require Level 2. Refer to the <a href="#example-scenarios">Example Scenarios</a> section below for more detailed examples of how to align target levels of data security maturity to the needs and risks of an organization.</p><p>Once the appropriate targets are defined, the team will need to evaluate their existing security processes and tools to identify potential gaps that will be addressed in the following step.</p><h3 id="develop-and-implement-the-data-security-plan" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#develop-and-implement-the-data-security-plan" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Develop and Implement the Data Security Plan</h3><p>Based on the previous analysis, the organization can build a coordinated plan to reach the needed Level of maturity for each data type or use case. For each Objective and maturity Level, the DSMM identifies methods and tools that can be used to achieve the target goal. However, these are provided as examples only, and should not be considered an exhaustive list or the only ways that an organization can achieve the appropriate level of maturity.</p><p>Teams should evaluate any newly implemented controls to ensure they are functioning properly and delivering the desired effect.</p><p>Once deployed, organizations should continue to monitor the efficacy of the program and regularly re-evaluate their data security program to adapt to changing workflows, data usage, and business needs.</p><h2 id="example-scenarios" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-scenarios" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Example Scenarios</h2><p>Naturally, not every organization will need to be at Level 3 or even Level 2 for all Objectives. The appropriate Objectives should be defined based on each organization&#39;s business needs and tolerance for risk. An organization can reasonably be content at Level 3 in one area and at Level 1 in others. The following scenarios provide some examples of how an organization&#39;s need might align to various target levels of maturity.</p><h3 id="scenario-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenario-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scenario 1</h3><p>Online health service provides health and genetic testing by mail, and provides a centralized portal for customers to review their results and recommendations. Due to the sensitive nature of patient and regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI, GDPR), protecting customers is the #1 priority for the firm.</p><p>In this case, the primary dataset that the firm will focus on is quite well-defined. Since the data is relatively well-known, data discovery and classification may not be a top priority. The organization may start with a target of Level 1 for Identify and Classify or may need to target Level 2 to address any cloud-to-cloud sharing or to identify potential misuse of sensitive data by the firm&#39;s internal administrators. However, the ability to protect data and respond to incidents will be a clear priority and the organization will target Level 3 for these functions.</p><ul><li><strong>Identify and Classify -</strong> Level 1 or 2</li><li><strong>Protect -</strong> Level 3</li><li><strong>Detect -</strong> Level 2</li><li><strong>Respond -</strong> Level 3</li><li><strong>Recover and Improve -</strong> Level 1 or 2</li></ul><h3 id="scenario-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenario-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scenario 2</h3><p>Technology Integrator and Services firm develops and implements a variety of proprietary software solutions for its clients. Each project is highly customized and confidential and tied to specific dedicated teams. Projects can also be relatively dynamic as team members regularly rotate on and off a project when needs change. The firm deals with a wide range of sensitive data including source code, product designs, and development plans, as well as sensitive customer communications.</p><p>In this case the firm must protect a wide range of datatypes in which many users will need to interact with the data. This will require the organization to target Level 3 of <strong>Identify</strong>** and Classify <strong>in order to identify many types of data that will naturally be distributed across many endpoints, applications, and cloud services.</strong> Protect <strong>and</strong> Detect <strong>efforts will also be at Level 3 in order to prevent the loss of sensitive data either due to external threats, malicious insiders, or internal errors.

The employee would receive a token allowing them to view your data for 60 minutes. Such a measure would go a long way towards preventing massive theft of data by malicious insiders or stolen accounts of employees, while also providing a provable audit trail of who read what customer information.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><!----><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 34368506+stods21@users.noreply.github.com">Stods21</span><!--[-->, <!--]--><!--]--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: louis.holt@esprofiler.com">Louis Holt</span><!--[-->, <!--]--><!--]--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: guillaume.ross@jupiterone.com">Guillaume Ross</span><!--[-->, <!--]--><!--]--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 117521562+ESPLouis@users.noreply.github.com">Louis</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
